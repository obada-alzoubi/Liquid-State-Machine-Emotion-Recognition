# Liquid State Machine Implantation for Emotion Recognition form EEG
The code and scripts here are collections of Spiking Neural Network implementation ported and modified to perform emotion recognition from EEG.
## How to start!
The code is somehow complex, but you can contact me to start with!
Please see this reference for liquid state machine implementation used in the code
